A few weeks ago I was having dinner with my girlfriend. Somehow she showed me a treasure trove of hidden potential.

While munching away, we decided it was fun to play [36 questions][0]. A get to know your date questionnaire.

Though I thought we would know each other after 3 years, I still learned a lot.

When I asked her; "honestly tell me what you specifically like about me?"

She replied:

_"How you love your stupid nerdy passions. It's amazing how you geek out and don't care what other people think about it."_

I looked her in the face and started grinning. Did she really just say that? Where is an engagement ring if you need it!?

Meanwhile, in the back of my head, 12 year old me just went: "wtf happened! Girls dig nerdy shit?"

So apparantly(!) people can be attracted to you, because you are proud to be a nerd?! Proud to be your self.

How did this come to be?

In the past I alway hid my geeky hobbies. Hiding my Magic cards and not exactly flaunting my 100 episode Naruto binges.

But when friends or family would find out. They only point out how stupid it was. Leaving me with shame and resentment.

It is not a place you like to be. But slowly yet steadily I started to care less what other people thought about it.

I found reasoning and courage through reading [Nietzsche][1],[Seneca][2]and[Buddha][3]. As well find inspiration in fiction and anime. Like one of my favourites: happy-go-lucky Luffy. He just does whatever the fuck he wants!

I was slowly becoming more stoic, but the tipping point came through reading this:

> Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to play it cool about how much you like something. It's basically a license to proudly emote on a somewhat childish level rather than behave like a supposed adult. Being a geek is extremely liberating."  
> [Simon Pegg][4]

That's when I stopped giving a fuck.

It felt liberating! Haven't regretted it.

So yes, people still call me out. For example when discussing [ASOIF consipracies][5]. But I don't care - and just revel in my pleasure.

Everyone has his or her strange little quirks, passions and style. So what?

No reason to define your passions by (pop)culture standards. Totally arbitrary social concessions that don't define real value.

Especially not what is valuable to you!

Embrace what you love. Your passion is a key stone to who you are and thus your self-confidence. Apparently it can even be a major turn on!

Stop hiding what you love. Express it and share it. So from now on:

### Be proud of your passion

Take pride in what you love. It is your passion right? You have all the permission in the world to be proud. Start giving yourself that permission as well! Let your enjoyment shine through.

### Don't let others define what is cool for you

Because other people, or the mainstream (oooow the mainstream), don't recognize your hobby as cool. Does not mean it isn't!

There is no international coolness committee, who decides what is hip or square. If you think it's cool, than it is cool! Don't waste your time wondering what 'most people' think.

### Don't compromise your passion

When you meet someone new. Or get to know someone better. Your might be inclined to hide your geekdom. But there is no reason you should hide what you love. Neither diminish it because of other perceived standards.

Being a lawyer doesn't mean you can't still enjoy Warhammer. Define yourself with all yourquirksfeatures!

Someone tries to make fun of it? Tell them you don't care. Especially not about his conformist standards. You have your own values and opinions!

### Don't expect everybody to understand

Though you can thrive in your passion. A lot of people won't get it. No problem. You won't get some people's passions either. But that's cool.  
You can still talk enthusiastically about it.

### Keep enjoying and sharing your passions

Whatever you do, keep doing what you love. If something is just good for you do it. Start sharing your joy with like minded and new people. What better way to share the wealth and create mutual enjoyment. Show your fiery passion.

GoT, LoTR and Star Wars would never have huge audiences. Not if some hardcore geeks hadn't stay true relentlessly. What a waste would that have been! Maybe by sharing your passion - you will enlighten many more people as well!

Show your pride! People have respect and are attracted to your uncompromising passions. These are your strengths. This is what makes you who you are! This is a big part of your confidence!

So share the wealth. Tell me what is your passion?

And how do you let it shine through? Or were do you regret not showing it more?
